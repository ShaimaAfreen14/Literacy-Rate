# Literacy-Rate
This is a WebScraping project. In this project we are analyzing the literacy rate of India.
Here I have used python’s Requests, BeautifulSoup module to web scrape the data for my project.
Later converted the data to data frames using python’s pandas module.
The following are the websites I used for WebScraping the data:

--> https://www.theglobalstatistics.com/literacy-rate-in-india/ ,

--> https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/IND/india/literacy-rate , 

--> https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/literacy-rate-by-country
After creating data frames from the scraped data, we saved the data frames to .csv file.
Later imported the datasets to power BI.
Performed few transformations on the data.
Analyzed the data by using various visualization charts on power BI.

Here we are using following modules:

-->bs4: BeautifulSoup is a python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. 

-->requests: This module allows us to send HTTP requests extremely easy.
